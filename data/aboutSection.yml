  ### Iâ€™m Isaac, a Software Development Student working to achieve my BTEC qualification.

  Over the past few years, I have expanded proficiency in various
  technological areas, displaying aptitude in the use of operating systems, programming languages and
  multiple web technologies.  
  
    As I complete my studies, I am now exploring ways to progress my passion.  

  My days are normally spent researching, designing, listening to music, and programming. I also like to spend my time adventuring to new places!
