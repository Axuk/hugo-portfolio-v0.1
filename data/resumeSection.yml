      Where I used to do fundraising to attending various events, I am now currently developing a C# console-based program which will connect to a MySQL database.
    

      Whilst I develop this program, I have planned to use the Object-Oriented programming paradigm to make this program fully functional, utilising the maximum potential of it’s encompassed techniques.

      #### Tesco

      I was originally tasked to work within the Non-food team where I stacked the shelves, cleared all empty boxes and ensured a tidy work environment (this is called Rumble) as well as making sure stock was correctly sorted in the warehouse.
    

      On a day-to-day basis, I developed my communication and self-confidence skills. This also gave me the chance to improve my self-motivation and demonstrated punctuality, commitment and approachability.
    

      Later on through my employment, due to a change in business model, I was moved to the DotCom department where I picked products out for customers’ online orders. I used my initiative to identify the most appropriate alternative products if an item was out of stock to provide the best customer satisfaction.
      
      
      I resigned at the end of August due to the shift times offered being incompatible with my college timetable.
    time: Personal Shopper, 23rd Mar - 29th Aug 2020

      #### Cyber Security Associates

      During the first weeks Work Experience, I developed a Raspberry Pi project where I created a file server using Samba along with a virus (that I created using Python) to infect the files on the server.
    

      Played a part as an effective team member at which I achieved all objectives and tasks set, displaying my strong analytical and investigative skills along with a thirst to develop bespoke programming skills.
    

      Demonstrated a proactive approach and excellent communication skills.


      Over the second period of Work Experience here, I made a functional VPN using OpenVPN and X509 PKI. I used specific networking practices such as TLS and SSL protocols to create a connection between the client and the server. This was my first hands-on experience working within a Linux environment and demonstrated my organisational skills, attention to detail and logical working.
    time: Work Experience, 29th Jul - 9th Aug 2019
